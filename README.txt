Hi there,

This is my personal website I'm using to explain my work and some part of my life in a different perspective: my perspective. Not that it is great, but it is the way I think is good. I always wanted to put everything in one place and maybe that's my chance.

Feel free to use this template for yourelf, I got this one from html5up.net (@ajlkn - free for personal and commercial use under the CCA 3.0 license, html5up.net/license).

I hope you like it!
