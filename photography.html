								<p>I was born and grew up in <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/GrFWM5baZyZV9UyK9">Porto Alegre-RS</a>, southern Brazil. My academic career was based in the Department of Zoology at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), where I have concluded my bachelor in Biological Sciences studying the taxonomy and systematics of freshwater fishes. During the masters and the PhD – now living at the coast, I have investigated the ontogeny, evolution and functional morphology of the sound generating structures in dolphins. The main idea was to answer how dolphins evolved different head shapes into similar sound production capabilities, and how unique features might reflect the natural history of some particular species.</p>
