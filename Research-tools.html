                <h2>Gross dissection</h2>
								<p>This technique is the oldest scientific discipline of medicine as the first human dissection is documented in Alexandria in the third century B.C. During my masters and PhD, I have basically used gross dissections to investigate the sound-generating structures of some dolphin species. The first species I have studied was the Franciscana dolphin, which I described the development of the main structures involved in sound production, and the general differences between adults and calves. A dissection is basically removing  tissues ‘layer by layer, keeping adjacent structures intact as much as possible’ as stated by Schenkkan (1972) while investigating the broadest study comparing the nasal cavity of several dolphin species. The descriptions are based on notes and photographs made during the dissections.</p>

								<p>Although I have focused my studies on small dolphins (that for me are the most easy to be studied this way), I have also the opportunity to dissect, literally, from small freshwater fishes to sperm whales. For small fishes, I clear and stained (c&s) some specimens to analyze the skeleton morphology based on Taylor and Van Dyke (<a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=pt-BR&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=Taylor%2C+W.+R.%2C+%26+Van+Dyke%2C+G.+C.+%281985%29.+Revised+procedures+for+staining+and+clearing+small+fishes+and+other+vertebrates+for+bone+and+cartilage+study.+Cybium%2C+9%282%29%2C+107%E2%80%93119.&btnG=">1985</a>). With this technique, we remove soft tissues while coloring bones and cartilages with blue and pink, respectively. For big whales, we need a bit more infrastructure. The first time I dissected a whale with all the tools available was in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/B%C3%BCsum,+Alemanha/@54.1370867,8.8236815,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x47b474e60f8db11f:0x708df40096f937f1!8m2!3d54.1346218!4d8.8585913">Büsum</a>, Germany, where we had a truck to hold the big pieces of blubber while we were accessing its internal organs. No, we did not could see the lens of the sperm whale, maybe it is just visible using imaging analysis such as CT scans.</p>

								<h2>Histology and Anatomic Geometry</h2>
								<p>I have used histological techniques to assess the morphology of the nasal tract in fetal specimens of some dolphin species using hematoxylin-eosin staining. I have prepared the head of a Franciscana dolphin fetus, and compared to other species already prepared and stored in scientific collections. To demonstrate the morphology of the structures, I have digitized a series of 50 of these slices (i.e., spaced 40 µm each other) and used this image sequence as a input for 3D reconstructions using <a href="https://www.slicer.org/">Slicer3D</a>. In that case I have even converted the image sequence to DICOM format, but you can also use jpeg images as well. The results can be seen in <a href="https://academic.oup.com/biolinnean/article/128/3/700/5550896">this paper</a>.</p>

								<p>I grouped these two approaches here just because I have somehow combined them in terms of my research questions, which was to demonstrate the development of soft-tissue structures throughout the development. The difference is how the sequence of images are generated and how to process them. For late fetuses and very young individuals it is possible to use conventional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans which takes a long time. However, computed tomography (CT) scans demonstrated to be useful to define the fat structures and other connective tissues. The CT-scan is quicker than the MRI, which makes the logistics more productive and less stressful because you always depend on the patience and disponibility of an operator that saves time to scan some dolphins' heads. Since the best scans are placed in human clinics, I put a lot of effort on trying to get access to those ones. The first time I scanned a dolphin I passed through the waiting room carrying a dead dolphin the size of a nine years old kid.</p>

Not only the 3D models can be stored in digital repositories, but printing these models could be useful for science outreach.</p>

								<h2>Phylogenetics</h2>
								<p>This is a very broad topic and represents the base for all the studies I have done so far, or at least the way I see the world. Systematics and classification are extremely important to understand biodiversity since we can only assess and conserve what we know. I have used the phylogenetic approach to determine the phylogenetic relationship of small freshwater fishes found in scientific collections, which did not fit in any descriptions for other species in the family. The family Characidae is the largest family of freshwater fishes and I have included the specimens I had in hand into this matrix. In total, I have used 520 morphological characters already described and created five more, and also used three molecular sequences (16S, CytB, COI). I ran the matrix using parsimony and extended implied weighting (<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cla.12047?casa_token=krn0_7JgedIAAAAA%3AH17W8G2oY-78Erafr2eVjLFuOjmfWKGi7ei8zduVxlUdQ5YGtHlWjr18q-CKe_LXrmCWU1vv7Jiqr7A">Goloboff, 2014</a>). All the analysis was done using <a href="http://www.lillo.org.ar/phylogeny/tnt/">TNT</a> software, but I like to sort the matrix using <a href="https://www.mesquiteproject.org/">Mesquite</a>.</p>

								<h2>Morphometric Geometrics</h2>
								<p>There are so many questions to answer using this approach but I will mention a bit just what I have done. This is the most used approach to investigate shape variation in a series of specimens stored in scientific collections. Shape variation is based on the distance and angles formed by several anatomical landmarks, which are homologous points on the anatomical structures such as bone junctions. There are basically two ways of sampling shape information: (1) based on photographs (2D), where you set the landmarks for each view you have photographed the individuals; and (2) using a 3D digitizer such as a MicroScribe, where the landmarks are taken and stored in a 3D environment.</p>

    CanvasMatrix4 class

    This class implements a 4x4 matrix. It has functions which
    duplicate the functionality of the OpenGL matrix stack and
    glut functions.
