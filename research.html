										<h2><a href="#">What are you listening for?</a></h2>
										<p>The main questions guiding my research interest, and the tools I have found to answer them</p>

								<p> I am originally from Brazil, where I have graduated in Biological Sciences at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil) the same institution I have also completed the masters and the PhD. Although I have accumulated experience in the industry as a Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) operator during seismic surveys, my career is basically academic. I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Cape Town, South Africa.</p> 
								<p> My undergraduate experience took place in a Ichthyology Laboratory, which not only gave me the basis for comparative biology studies such as taxonomy and systematics, and also the experience with scientific collections, but guided me to build an original project that would turn into my research topic. I have investigated the evolution and the functional anatomy of the sound production in dolphins during my masters and the PhD, thus accumulating knowledge on cetacean anatomy, evolution and acoustics, which gave me a wider understanding on the topic. I had the opportunity to be awarded with a fellowship from the Brazilian government to work with Dr. Stefan Huggenberger during part of my PhD at the University of Cologne, Germany, which was important to develop my skills as a researcher. In addition, while a graduate student, I have also worked as a volunteer in several projects focused on cetaceans, especially one that studies the “cooperative fishing” between dolphins and fishermen in southern Brazil. In this project, which is coordinated by Dr. Ignacio B. Moreno, I have helped instructing undergraduate and graduate students in several sub-projects such as: using photo-ID to monitor the resident population (as photographer and assisting to analyze the data); investigating the behavioral repertoire of bottlenose dolphins using UAV (as drone pilot and helping a graduate student to classify the behaviors - not published yet); leading boat-based surveys for the Gephyreus Project in order to monitor the endangered Lahille’s bottlenose dolphin (<i>Tursiops gephyreus</i>) from southern Brazil, Uruguay and Argentine (mainly Photo-ID and biopsy sampling); and also performing several sub-projects on environmental education for the outreach.</p>  
								<p> After an experience as a fisheries observer and in the oil industry as PAM operator, I have started a postdoctoral experience at the University of Cape Town, South Africa, working together with the NGO <a href="https://seasearch.co.za/">Sea Search Research and Conservation</a> that is led by Dr. Tess Gridley and Dr. Simon Elwen. Here, I  improved my skippering skills and got very engaged in boat and trailer maintenance. Among other studies on whale and seal acoustics, the research group investigates the use of dolphin signature whistles for mark-recapture studies. I am now assisting a PhD student that focused this approach for the Indian Ocean humpback dolphin (<i>Sousa plumbea</i>) in South African waters. Since there are three other whistling dolphin species (i.e., common dolphins, Indian Ocean bottlenose dolphins and killer whales) overlapping humpback dolphin’s distribution, I am building a machine learning toolbox using convolutional neural networks to detect and classify dolphin sounds at species level in long-term recordings. This project is being awarded by Microsoft Azure through AI for earth grants and it is currently in its final stages.</p>
